                <div class="blog-post-content">
                    <p>I'm thrilled to announce the upcoming launch of a project I've been working on for the past few months: <strong>JF Website Monitor</strong>. This isn't just another uptime checker; it's a comprehensive monitoring solution designed for developers, agencies, and online businesses who need to know not only if their site is online, but if it's working correctly.</p>

                    <h2>The Problem with "Uptime"</h2>
                    <p>Traditional uptime monitors are great for one thing: telling you if your server is responding. But what if your site is online, but the content has been replaced with a malicious script? What if a botched deployment breaks the layout on mobile devices? Most monitoring tools would still report "100% Uptime."</p>
                    <p>This is the problem I set out to solve with JF Website Monitor. I wanted a tool that could answer the question: "Is my website <em>really</em> okay?"</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"Your website can be 'up' and still be completely broken. True monitoring is about ensuring correctness, not just availability."</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>What Makes JF Website Monitor Different?</h2>
                    <p>JF Website Monitor combines three key areas of monitoring into one simple-to-use platform:</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Real-Time Uptime Monitoring</h3>
                    <p>Of course, we start with the basics. With checks as fast as every 15 seconds from multiple geographic locations, you'll be the first to know if your site goes down. Track response times, get detailed performance metrics, and receive instant alerts via email, SMS, or webhook.</p>

                    <h3>2. Content Change Detection</h3>
                    <p>This is where JF Website Monitor really shines. We take regular HTML snapshots of your pages and compare them. If anything changes—from a single line of text to a full-blown defacement—you get an alert. Our side-by-side diff viewer shows you exactly what changed, so you can quickly identify unauthorized modifications or accidental deletions.</p>

                    <h3>3. SLA Compliance and Reporting</h3>
                    <p>For agencies and freelancers, proving that you're meeting your Service Level Agreements (SLAs) is crucial. JF Website Monitor provides detailed, exportable PDF reports of uptime and performance. You can filter logs by date and status to create comprehensive documentation for clients.</p>
